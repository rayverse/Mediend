Mediend: Every Doctor's medical friend.

Mediend is an Early Disease Detection program that uses Python in it's front end and MySQL in its backend. The first iteration as of now is simply a streamlit interface that runs as an app on your browser.
Mediend uses AI and ML especially NLP to train its model. This training model learns from datasets previously stored in it's database. The database is constantly updating as doctors use the app. When a doctor enters a medical report, the report is stored in the database for further training of the model.

We have plans on making the datasets wider, larger and more specific so as to ensure our training model medical accuracy and confidence.
